                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="text">Hi, it's me, Mingjie. Thanks for taking your 
                    time to check my website. To get things started, let me 
                    introduce a bit about myself. Right now, I am studying at 
                    the University of Waterloo, pursuing a degree in Data 
                    Science and hoping to graduate by 2024. This is my personal 
                    website, and also my first experience with website 
                    development. This website is around three topics: computer 
                    programming, math, and art, all of which I've been 
                    really passionate about. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">To me, sharing ideas is just as important as 
                    creating ideas. I do not expect anyone to get inspired by 
                    my work, although it is nice to provide some inspiration. I 
                    am hoping that by viewing my work, you can learn more about 
                    myself.

                        development with Python, I decided to build a Python maze 
                        game with graphics UI. The game features include score 
                        counter, timer, scrolling map, buttons, and keyboard 
                        events.

                    <h2>Maze Generator</h2>
                    <p class="text">This project is a maze generator achieved with recursive 
                        back-tracking algorithm. The maze map is first recorded 
                        in a text file, and then the game is put together with 
                        the UI from SDL2. Here is how recursive backtracking 
                        works in this project:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">1. Choose a starting point in the field. </p>
                    <p class="text">2. Randomly choose a wall at that point and carve a 
                        passage through to the adjacent cell, but only if the 
                        adjacent cell has not been visited yet. This becomes 
                        the new current cell.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">3. If all adjacent cells have been visited, back up to 
                        the last cell that has uncarved walls and repeat. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">4. The algorithm ends when the process has backed all 
                        the way up to the starting point.

                    <h2>Colour Detector</h2>
                    <p class="text">One of my hobbies is creating art. There 
                        are many times when I want to know the rgb values from  
                        an image. This inspired me to implement a colour picker 
                        on my own. The result is an easy-to-use program that 
                        enables the user to access the colour codes of a 
                        selected image.

                    <p class="text">This document discusses the average 
                        Euclidean distance between two random points in a unit 
                        hypercube. It was written after I completed my first 
                        university-level statistics course, and was an 
                        application of the knowledge that I obtained from that 
                        course. Three math problems were solved. The first two 
                        involve evaluating the average distance in lower 
                        dimensions (one and two dimensions). The last one 
                        involves an approximation of the average distance in 
                        higher dimensions. The quality of the approximation was 
                        then checked by using MATLAB.

                    <h2>Sangaku Circle Geometry</h2>
                    <p class="text">I consider geometry as a big game of 
                        shapes. I love shapes. This is why I am fond of 
                        geometry and art. This document discusses three 
                        geometry problems with tangent circles, from simple to 
                        complicated, all of which were originated from Japan 
                        hundreds of years ago. Tangent circles are known as 
                        circles in a common plane that intersect in a single 
                        point. The key to solving these problems is to make use 
                        of the right angles formed by the tangent circles. Most 
                        interestingly, the last problem was solved by reducing 
                        the problem to a simpler one using conformal mapping in 
                        the complex number system.
